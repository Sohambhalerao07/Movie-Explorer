# Movie-Explorer
Movie Explorer is a React-based web application that allows users to explore movies, view detailed information about each movie, and manage their favorite movies. It fetches movie data from the OMDb API and presents it in an easy-to-use interface. Users can search for movies, view their details, and add or remove them from their favorites list.
